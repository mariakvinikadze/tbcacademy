## Getting Started

This guide will help you get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before setting up the project, ensure you have Node.js installed on your system. You can download it from the [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/). You will also need npm (which comes with Node.js) or Yarn, which can be installed from the [Yarn website](https://yarnpkg.com/).

### Installation

After downloading or pulling the project to your local machine, install the dependencies:

#### Using npm:

```
npm install
```

#### Using Yarn:

```
yarn
```

### Running the Project

To start the development server:

#### Using npm:

```
npm run dev
```

#### Using Yarn:

```
yarn dev
```

This command will launch the Vite development server and open the project in your default web browser.

### Building for Production

To create an optimized build for production:

#### Using npm:

```
npm run build
```

#### Using Yarn:

```
yarn build
```

This command will generate a `dist` folder containing the production-ready assets.
